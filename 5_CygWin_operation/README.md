## Work with CygWin 

> 1. The developers gave us a task: we need to find out what requests came from an IP address. An IP address consists of four numbers separated by dots. You need addresses that start with "233.201.".
> The logs are on a remote server at logs/2019/12. The day the error occurred is unknown. 
> Your task is to find out what requests were sent.

> 2. A bug has been detected in the system. It manifested itself on 12/30/2019 and 12/31/2019 from 21:30:00 to 21:39:59. At the same time, errors with numbers 400 and 500 appeared. Your task is to save to a separate file the logs that were recorded during this period.  
> Then these logs should be divided into separate files: logs with the same error put in one file
