## This will show examples of how to work with the database

> 1. You have a database with cab rides. The plan was to have 10550 cars on the service line - this figure covers user demand. The team received a lot of complaints: there were not enough cars available. How many cabs were actually on the line?
>
> 2. Count the number of cars in each company from the cabs table. Sort the values in descending order. The command assumes that some companies have not put enough cars on the line. 
Output those companies with fewer than 100 cars. Name the field with the number of cars as "cnt", the field with the company name as "company_name".
>
> 3. The cab app calculates a coefficient for the cost of a trip. If the weather is good, the coefficient is 1. If it is raining or stormy, the coefficient increases to 2. The team has a hypothesis that there is an error in the coefficient calculation. To check the coefficient calculation, the team needs a sample of data: the developer can check the coefficient with the data in the logs and fix the bug. Your task is to get the sample.
>
> 4. After a software update, taxi fleets began reporting that the profits they were making did not match the data the app was giving them. Development suggests that the problem may be in the trip count data. 
To determine if there is a bug, we need to get a sample with the number of trips of each taxi fleet for November 15 and 16, 2017.
